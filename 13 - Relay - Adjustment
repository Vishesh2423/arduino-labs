// Use constant integers to establish the pin for the relay and the delay time

const int relayPin = 2; 
const int timeDelay = 500; 

// Use void setup() to write a function that only runs once.
// This established the relay pin as an output. 

void setup()
{
  pinMode(relayPin, OUTPUT);  // set pin as an output
}

// Use void loop() to write a function that runs as long as the Arduino has power.
// This loop function turns the relay pin on and off, with a delay in between.
// This drives the relay, and causes it to switch between the LEDs and the buzzer.
// Although this is the basic code for a blinking LED, the mechanical relay
// allows it to switch between two outputs, which is a very useful feature in certain
// applications.
// However, since the relay is mechanical, the delay speed cannot be too short
// or the relay can wear out and break. 

void loop()                    
{
  digitalWrite(relayPin, HIGH);  // turn the relay on

  delay(timeDelay);              // wait for one second

  digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW);   // turn the relay off

  delay(timeDelay);              // wait for one second
