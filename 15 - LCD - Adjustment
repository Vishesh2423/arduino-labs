  LCD - Serial Data Transmission

// To operate the Liquid Crystal Display, we need to "#include" the liquid crystal library:
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

// Use constant integers to establish the connections for the LCD.
// Multiple integers can be established in the same command if they are seperated by a comma.

const int rs = 12, en = 11, d4 = 5, d5 = 4, d6 = 3, d7 = 2;
LiquidCrystal lcd(rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7);

// Use void setup() to write a function that only runs once.
// This sets up the LCD as a 16x2 display.
// This also begins receiving and transmitting information through the serial monitor.

void setup() 
{
  lcd.begin(16, 2);

  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// Use void loop() to write a function that runs as long as the Arduino has power.
// This loop function reads the data sent through the serial monitor and displays it on the LCD.
// After setting the cursor, it checks if there is any serial data available.
// "if" there is, then the LCD is cleared.
// Along with that, while serial data is available, the LCD will display it
// As soon as there is no new serial data, the "if" loop becomes invalid and the program is static until there is new data.
// This acts as a "printer", where the data is entered through an input (serial monitor) and displayed through an output (LCD).

void loop() 
{
  lcd.setCursor(0,1);
  if (Serial.available()) 
  {
    delay(100);
    lcd.clear();
    while (Serial.available() > 0) 
    {
      lcd.write(Serial.read());
    }
  }
