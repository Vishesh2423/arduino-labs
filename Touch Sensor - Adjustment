// Use void loop() to write a function that runs as long as the Arduino has power.
// This loop function collects boolean data from the sensor and assigns it to "r"
// If the touch sensor is not being touched, all LEDs are off
// If the sensor is touched briefly, only the green LEDs turn on
// If the sensor is touched for a little longer, the yellow LEDs turn on as well
// If the sensor is touched for a while, the red LEDs turn on.
// If the sensor is touched for too long, all the LEDs will turn off.
// In this manner, the touch sensor drives the LEDs based on how long it is held down.
